Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.  This means it's designed to be relatively easy for humans to read and write, and it can be used for a wide variety of tasks, unlike languages that are specialized for a specific purpose (like web development only).

Here's a breakdown of key characteristics:

* **High-level:**  You don't need to worry about low-level details like managing memory directly. Python handles much of this automatically, making development faster and easier.

* **General-purpose:**  It can be used for web development (using frameworks like Django and Flask), data science (with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn), machine learning, scripting, automation, game development, and much more.

* **Interpreted:**  Python code is executed line by line by an interpreter, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution. This makes it easier to debug and test code.

* **Dynamically typed:** You don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable (like `int`, `string`, etc.). Python infers the type at runtime.

* **Object-oriented:** Python supports object-oriented programming principles, allowing you to organize code into reusable objects and classes.

* **Large and active community:**  A vast community of developers contributes to Python's libraries, frameworks, and tools, providing extensive support and resources.

* **Extensive libraries:** A huge ecosystem of pre-built modules and libraries makes it easy to add functionality to your programs without writing everything from scratch.

In short, Python's combination of readability, versatility, and extensive libraries makes it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced programmers across many different fields.
