Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition.  It's a way to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.  Think of it like a set of Russian nesting dolls: each doll contains a smaller version of itself, until you reach the smallest doll.

Here's a breakdown of how recursion works:

**1. Base Case:** Every recursive function *must* have a base case. This is a condition that stops the function from calling itself endlessly.  Without a base case, the function will continue to call itself until it runs out of memory, resulting in a stack overflow error. The base case defines the simplest instance of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion.

**2. Recursive Step:** This is where the function calls itself, but with a modified input that moves it closer to the base case.  This step breaks down the problem into smaller, similar subproblems.

**3. Return Value:** The recursive calls eventually reach the base case, which returns a value. This value is then passed back up the chain of recursive calls, until the initial call returns the final result.


**Example: Calculating Factorial**

The factorial of a non-negative integer n (denoted by n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.  For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

Here's a recursive function in Python to calculate the factorial:

```python
def factorial(n):
  """Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer using recursion."""
  if n == 0:  # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    return 1
  else:
    return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive step: n! = n * (n-1)!

print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

**Explanation:**

* **Base Case:** `if n == 0: return 1`  This handles the simplest case: the factorial of 0 is 1.
* **Recursive Step:** `return n * factorial(n - 1)` This is where the magic happens.  The function calls itself with a smaller input (`n - 1`).  It multiplies the current value of `n` by the factorial of `n - 1`.

Let's trace the execution for `factorial(5)`:

1. `factorial(5)` calls `factorial(4)`
2. `factorial(4)` calls `factorial(3)`
3. `factorial(3)` calls `factorial(2)`
4. `factorial(2)` calls `factorial(1)`
5. `factorial(1)` calls `factorial(0)`
6. `factorial(0)` hits the base case and returns `1`
7. `factorial(1)` receives `1` and returns `1 * 1 = 1`
8. `factorial(2)` receives `1` and returns `2 * 1 = 2`
9. `factorial(3)` receives `2` and returns `3 * 2 = 6`
10. `factorial(4)` receives `6` and returns `4 * 6 = 24`
11. `factorial(5)` receives `24` and returns `5 * 24 = 120`


**Advantages of Recursion:**

* **Elegance and Readability:** Recursive solutions can be more concise and easier to understand for problems that naturally have a recursive structure (like tree traversal or fractal generation).
* **Code Reusability:**  The same function is used to solve different subproblems.

**Disadvantages of Recursion:**

* **Stack Overflow:**  Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the base case isn't reached within a reasonable number of calls.
* **Performance Overhead:**  Function calls have some overhead, so recursive solutions can be less efficient than iterative solutions in some cases.
* **Debugging Complexity:**  Debugging recursive functions can be more challenging than debugging iterative functions.


**When to Use Recursion:**

Recursion is best suited for problems that can be naturally broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.  Examples include:

* Tree traversal
* Graph algorithms
* Sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort)
* Mathematical functions (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci sequence)
* Fractal generation


It's important to carefully consider the trade-offs between recursion and iteration before choosing an approach.  In many cases, an iterative solution might be more efficient and less prone to errors.  However, recursion can often provide a more elegant and understandable solution for certain types of problems.
